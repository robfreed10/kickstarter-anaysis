Performing analysis on Louise's kickstarter data to uncover trends 
# Overview 
Louise requested analysis for her kickstarter campagins. She was interested in finding trends in the data of how successful or unsuccessful her campaigns were at certain points of the year. She had also requested that analysis was needed for how successful or unsuccessful the campaigns were based on the category "plays" and goal of the campaign, which was how much money was needed in order for the play to be funded.
This analysis is crucial for Louise as we hoped to identify which months were deemed best to launch her campaigns and maybe which months were not so great. It is also crucial that her goal for the campaigns not be such a large sum of money, which later will show results on how campaigns fared at certain intervals of money goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Campaign Launch Date
First, I extracted data from Louise's kickstarter data set and wanted to see the outcomes of these campaigns based on the launch date. Originally, her data had presented time in unix, which is very hard to understand to the human eye. This could be a difficult task to overcome as the unix time is a 10 digit number that looks like it could be a bar code for some product. Anyway, using the YEAR function in Excel, I had determined which year each campaign began shown below.

Next,  the data was filtered to show the 3 outcomes of her campaigns: successful, cancelled & failed. Also the data was filtered to analyze the campaigns in the category labeled as "theater". Lastly, the data was grouped by month and I produced a Pivot Table and Chart showing the results of the outcomes of Louise's theater kickstarters based on the launch date. Pivot Chart shown below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next part of the analysis required myself to analyze the data for plays and intervals of the goals that she was seeking to kickstart those campaigns. Using the COUNTIF function in Excel, I was able to easily find the number of successful, canceled, or failed campaigns, based on a specific interval for her goal. The interval started at less than 1,000 than graudually increased to 5,000 intervals like (10,000-14,999), (15,000-19,999), etc. Code for the COUNTIF function can be seen below.

Then based on those intervals, I calculated the sum for how many kickstarters needed that specific interval for its goal and established percentages for successful, canceled, and failed campaigns at the given interval. A line chart will show this data below.

### Results for Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on my findings, it can be stated with a fact that Louise's two most successful months for theater campaigns was May and June. Perhaps, the summer months have people in a generous mood and willing to help Louise reach her campaign goals. Also, in every month, there were more successful outcomes than failed outcomes for theater kickstarters. Perhaps this shows that the theater category is a big hit amongst the people donating her money. I would like to look at other categories, like music and food to see if similar results are found. Also, analyzing the outcomes on a quartley basis would be better for Louise so she could budget for each quarter accordingly. 
### Results for Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal
Based on my findings, as the interval of goal increased for play kickstarters, the percentage of successful outcomes declined at a steady rate from 76% success when the goal was less than 1,000 to 27% when the goal was between 30,000-34,999. However, the percentage of successful outcomes increases quite quickly from that last interval to 66.7% at the intervals (35,000-39,999) and (40,000-44,999). It is possible that the plays that required more funding were more universally loved amongst those who donated. Perhaps, the average number of donations decreased as the interval increased, which makes sense as some people may not want to spend as much if they see that a goal for a campaign is massive. None of Louise's campaigns were canceled, which I believe shows that Louise has a winners mentality and won't give up on her dreams until the very end.
